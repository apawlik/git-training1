## Conference on learning how to programn in R

My presentation is about me learning how to program in R.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# testing how calculating mean works
```{r}
mean( x <- 1:10)
```



## Including Plots - how about I make a change here

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
